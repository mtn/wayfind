"""
This script makes a series of HTTP POST requests against our Next.js /api/debug endpoints.
It mimics the equivalent DAP client sequence from the python debug test script:
  1. Launch the debug session.
  2. Issue an evaluation request for an expression (e.g. next_val).
  3. Send a continue request.

For a more complete test (e.g. breakpoints and stack traces) youâ€™d extend/chain more calls,
but this minimal script demonstrates how to automate our API testing.
